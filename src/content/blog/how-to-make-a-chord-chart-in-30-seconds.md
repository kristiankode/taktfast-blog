You're at band practice. Someone suggests a new song. Now everyone needs the chords — fast.

You could scribble them on paper, but good luck reading that from across the room. You could fire up a word processor, but aligning chords above lyrics is a nightmare with proportional fonts.

Here's a better way.

## The problem with most chord charts

Most musicians have been there: you type out lyrics, then try to line up chord names above the right syllables. You press space a few times, it looks right, then you change the font or zoom level and everything shifts.

The root cause is simple — **regular fonts have variable character widths**. The letter "i" is narrower than "m", so spacing that looks perfect in one context breaks in another.

Professional chord charts solve this with monospace fonts, where every character takes up exactly the same width. That's why `Courier New` is the musician's best friend.

## What makes a good chord chart?

A good chord chart has three qualities:

1. **Chords sit directly above the syllable where the change happens.** No guessing where to switch.
2. **Sections are clearly labeled.** Verse, chorus, bridge — everyone knows where they are.
3. **It's readable at a glance.** From a music stand, from an iPad on the floor, from across the room.

Here's what that looks like:

```
[Verse 1]
C              G
Amazing grace, how sweet
Am             F
the sound that saved
C
a wretch like me
```

## How to make one in 30 seconds

With [Klimp](https://klimp.taktfast.no), the process is dead simple:

1. **Type your lyrics.** Just paste or type the words into a section.
2. **Click above a syllable to place a chord.** A popup shows suggestions based on the key you've selected.
3. **Drag to adjust.** If a chord isn't in quite the right spot, drag it left or right. It snaps to character positions automatically.

That's it. Three steps.

The character-snapping system means your chords will always line up correctly, whether you're viewing on a phone, a tablet, or a laptop. No fiddling with spaces.

## Tips for better chord charts

**Set the key first.** When you set the song's key in Klimp, the chord suggestions automatically show you diatonic chords (the ones that naturally belong in that key). This saves time and reduces mistakes.

**Use section names.** Label your sections clearly: Verse 1, Chorus, Bridge. If a section repeats, use the repeat counter instead of duplicating it.

**Add practice notes.** Klimp lets you add yellow note boxes to any section. Use them for things like "build energy here" or "drums drop out" — the kind of instructions that don't fit in the chord chart itself.

**Keep it minimal.** Only write out chord changes. If a chord sustains for an entire line, you only need it at the start. Don't clutter the chart with redundant information.

## Share it with your band

Once your chart is ready, hit the share button. Your bandmates get a clean, formatted view they can pull up on any device. No account needed on their end either.

The whole point is speed. You should spend your practice time playing, not formatting documents.

## Why character-based positioning matters

Most chord chart tools position chords using pixel offsets or manual spacing. This breaks when:

- Someone zooms in on their tablet
- The font renders differently on another device
- You edit the lyrics and everything downstream shifts

Klimp stores each chord as a character index — "chord G is at position 13 in this line." That position is absolute relative to the text, so it survives any display change. It's a small technical detail that makes a big practical difference.
